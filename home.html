            <div class="row"> <h2>I believe I can change the world (or at least my corner of it).</h2></div>

            <div class="row">
             <p> I am a person who sees the bright side of everything. There are numerous things I enjoy doing, seeing, and experiencing.
                I enjoy reading and writing, I enjoy thinking and dreaming, I enjoy talking and listening.
                I enjoy watching the sunrise in the morning and the moonlight at night, I enjoy feeling the music on my face.
                I enjoy seeing the dawn in the morning and the moonlight at night, I enjoy feeling the music on my face and inhaling the scent of the sea breeze.
                 When I can't sleep in the middle of the night, I like to stare at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind and undertake thought experiments.
                 Flowers in the spring, rain in the summer, leaves in the autumn, and snow in the winter are all things I enjoy. I prefer to sleep early and wake up late. 
                 I prefer to be alone and I prefer to be surrounded by others. I enjoy country serenity as well as city noise. I enjoy Hangzhou's magnificent west lake as well as Champaign's flat cornfield.
                  Delicious cuisine and comfortable shoes are two of my favorite things, as are wonderful novels and romantic movies. I enjoy the country and environment, as well as people. I also enjoy laughing.</p>

                <h2 class="header-about">My short past</h2>
                <p>I was born in a small village in Dhunat, Bogura. The village is located on the banks of Ichhamati river. 
                    My small village is full of greenery. As a child, I was very mischievous as a village boy. 
                    I passed the SSC exam in 2014 from a village high school. Then I moved to Rajshahi city.
                    The city of Rajshahi was not very friendly to me. Admitted to Rajshahi Government City College. 
                    I passed the HSC exam in 2016. I could not do well in HSC examination due to illness. Which was the biggest failure of my past.

                    I was admitted in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Daffodil International University, Dhaka.
                     Now my last year is gone. I have been in the present village for a year for Corona Pandemic. 
                     Sapna Sopan has formed a small organization to stand by the helpless people and poor students of the village.
